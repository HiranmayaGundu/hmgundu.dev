# <Mark> Using Files as ConfigMaps in Kubernetes </Mark>

<br />{" "}

The canonical example for ConfigMaps in K8S looks something like this

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: special-config
  namespace: default
data:
  SPECIAL_LEVEL: very
  SPECIAL_TYPE: charm
```

Personally, I have some issues with this:-

1. When a developer manages the properties, I don't want the dev to accidentally mess with the other metadata that exists in the file.
2. It's YAML. YAML with its indentation based namespacing is _super easy_ to get wrong.
3. When you have a large number of properties, or multiple properties files, you have either multiple ConfigMaps or a really large ConfigMap YAML file.

Configuration changes based on environment, so you're probably using some form of templatization over the YAML. The following is an example in [Helm](https://helm.sh/)

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: special-config
  namespace: default
data:
  SPECIAL_LEVEL: { { .Values.special_level } }
  SPECIAL_TYPE: { { .Values.special_type } }
```

So my goals were to:-

1. Have propeties files seperate from the ConfigMap definition itself.
2. It should be templatized.
3. It should not be YAML.

So this is my solution!

File directory structure:

```bash
application-charts
|
|---config
|   |--- file.properties
|   |--- file2.properties
|---templates
|   |--- configmap.yaml
|   |--- deployment.yaml
|   |--- ...
|---values.production.yaml
|---values.qa.yaml
|--- ...
```

My ConfigMap.yaml looks like this

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: special-config
data: { { - (tpl (.Files.Glob "config/*").AsConfig . ) | nindent 2 } }
```

And my properties file looks like this

```bash
somePropertyThatIsConstant=HELLO
somePropertyThatChanges={{ .Values.some_property_that_changes }}
```

### Explanation

`.Files.Glob` is a helper that Helm provides to read directories inside the Helm chart folder structure, and `.AsConfig` is a helper
that reads the files as configuration. We then pass those files to the `tpl` function to replace the template strings in the files.
We pipe the result to `nindent 2` to correctly indent it with 2 spaces.
