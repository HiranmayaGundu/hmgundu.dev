The amazing thing about the software/tech industry is its openness and willingness to give back to the community. This is an industry
that was born out of people's hobbies. There are a lot of amazing resources online: open-source tools, services like [Vercel](https://vercel.com/),
which I use to host this blog and a lot of content to learn from. These blogs and tools helped me build my website, and I hope that they
serve as an inspiration to build yours too.

<br />

[Juan Olvera's Blog](https://jolvera.dev/) was the first one I found on my quest to build a blog. My goal was to build a static site
powered by markdown and his [post](https://jolvera.dev/posts/rebuilding-my-blog-with-nextjs) on rebuilding his blog with Next.js was
the blueprint I needed. His post also helped me discover the blog of the next person on this list!

<br />

[Max Stoiber's Blog](https://mxstbr.com/) is an **amazing** resource. I had wanted to learn `styled-components` and what better way to
learn than going through the code written by one of the creators of `styled-components`!

<br />

Both the blogs are open source, and I frequently dived into their code to learn how to do things. Through this, I was able to learn about
things like SEO, which is not _directly_ related to code. Going through the `Head` component, for example, led me to discover Open Graph
and Twitter Cards.

[Josh Comeau's blog](https://joshwcomeau.com/) is one of the most fun and beautiful blogs I have ever seen. The animations and sound effects!
I can't get enough of it üòç. I followed his [guide](https://joshwcomeau.com/gatsby/dark-mode/) for building the perfect dark mode. His blog
was the inspiration for my home page rebuild! It inspired me to learn how to animate on the web.

<br />

[Ruslan's Abramov's guide](https://roabramov.space/blog/hamburger-animation/) is the source of the wonderfully springy menu animation that you
see on mobile.

<br />

Designing things is not my forte! My initial choices for the background color(a deep red) with pink text was quesitionable, to say the _least_.
[Nord Theme](https://www.nordtheme.com/) is a beautiful open-source color palette that was the inspiration for the color palette I used on my site.
The use of SVG's on this site is also exquisite.

<br />

[Get waves](https://getwaves.io/) is the free tool I used to generate the SVG section separators. Really cool and easy to use!

<br />

I was inspired to make this blog because of [Dan Abramov's](https://overreacted.io/). I want to learn to communicate
complex programming concepts the way he does. I particularly love his blog on [algebraic effects](https://overreacted.io/algebraic-effects-for-the-rest-of-us/).

<br />

Lastly, I have some really solid friends! Vaishnavi Chandrakumar made the SVG of me for me and helped me choose the colors. Check her out on
[Issuu](https://issuu.com/vaishnavic/docs/portfolio_-_issuu) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/thepixelogue/).
