## <Mark> About Me </Mark>

Hi, I'm Hiranmaya Gundu. I'm a software developer from India, currently based in Bengaluru, Karnataka.

<br />

I'm an incoming graduate student at University of Southern California, and as of July 2021, have 2.5 years of
professional experience in the industry.

This website was born out of a desire to learn about React's server side rendering capabilities, as well as TypeScript.
