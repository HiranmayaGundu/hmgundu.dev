## <Mark> About Me </Mark>

Hi, I'm Hiranmaya Gundu. I'm a software developer from India, currently based in Bengaluru, Karnataka.

<br />

I'm a recent graduate of PES University, and as of Jan 2020, have about a year of professional experience in the industry.
I currently work as a Full Stack engineer, and learnt professional JavaScript and Web Development on the job.
This website was born out of a desire to learn about React's server side rendering capabilities, as well as TypeScript.

I'm currently actively looking to further my education through a graduate program. I have a strong interest in the Systems
and NLP fields.
