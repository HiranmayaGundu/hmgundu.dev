## My First Blog

My reason for starting a blog was simple. I wanted to start a personal side project.
After working for nearly a year (half of that year as intern), I realized that I have 
ridden of the high that joining a new job gives and that this was the time to experiment. 

<br />

As part of my job, as I googled for answers like we all do, I found some amazing personal
blogs, such as this one by [Dan Abarmov](https://overreacted.io/). Blogs give a place to 
express your technical opinions, and also generally improve your long form writing skills.
So I decided to make my first personal project a blog.

<br />

Having decided on building a blog, I started gathering my requirements. This was the list of 
things I wanted to do: 
- Use TypeScript - According to the [StackOverflow 2019 Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology-_-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-languages)
TypeScript is one of the most loved languages. I wanted to see what the fuss was all about. 
- Use Statically / Server rendered React - We use React at work, and wanted to explore features that I had not used yet. 
- Use Styled-Components - Wanted to learn this so that I could use it at work 
- Deploy this is a serverless manner.  

### Whatever you want to do, it's almost always solved

In the case of Statically / Server generated react, there are two main competitors, Next and Gatsby. A quick [google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=next+vs+gatsby)
will show you the pros and cons of each. I went with Next.js primarily because of it's integration with [now.sh](https://zeit.co/home). I achieved serverless deployments 
and server rendered react in one go. An especially impressive feature of Next is [Automatic Static Optimization](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/automatic-static-optimization)
It automatically emits a hydrated React application if you don't use the getInitialProps function. Plus, it helps that it uses PHP like pages directory!

<br />

Having decided to use Next.js, I looked for prior art. I found [Juan Olvera's blog](https://jolvera.dev/) and through that [Max Stoiber's blog](https://mxstbr.com/).
Serendipitously, Max Stoiber is one of the co-founder's of Styled-Components! So I used their code bases as \*ahem\* inspiration, and made my own.
A shoutout to both of them, I would not have a website without their blogs. 

### Things I learned while building this website


#### TypeScript and Rebass 
TypeScript is worth it, but in larger code bases, or code bases that are likely to evolve. It helps communicate the type of data your component takes 
very well and also catches invalid props at compile time, saving a lot of time! However, working on a small blog, I found types just to be a hinderance, 
especially with the strict typescript rules to prohibit the any type. And quite frequently, I found the compilation errors next to useless and hard to 
debug. I also could not use it on the NodeJS code. At least, not easily. Next.js, TypeScript and Node.js seemed to require conflicting javascript module 
systems, which I had learned about just because of this. TypeScript does not support the require syntax, while Node.js demands it. Facing all these issues,
I reverted to javascript for the get-blog-posts.js helper module.

Another thing to note is that rebass v4.0+ has moved to use Theme-UI, so to use styled-components with rebass, you have to import it like so: 

<br />

```javascript
import { Box } from 'rebass/styled-components'
import styled from 'styled-components'

// Use Box now and style it as you wish

const StyledBox = styled(Box)`
  color='blue';
`
```

Also, to use it with TypeScript, you will have to edit your tsconfig.json file and add the following: 

```json
{
  "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "rebass/styled-components": [
        "node_modules/@types/rebass"
      ]
    }
}
```

#### CSS and Design is still hard

If you look at my website closely (well, you don't really need to look at it closely) you'll find that in terms of styling it's 
a mix of the two blogs I've previously mentioned. Styling and design is really hard. Which is probably why nocode tools like 
[webflow](https://webflow.com/) are hot right now. CSS Styling seems like an easily automatable task, and soon designers will take
care of it rather then developers. 


### Features yet to be built

As I was working on this website, I realized there are somethings that still have to be built to get a proper blog. 
- A commenting system. I'll probably have a look at webmention or some other component that can be used. 
- A RSS Feed

<br /> 

I'll be adding these as and when I have time, but my primary focus will be on writing some blog posts!
