It strikes me that when it comes to Open Source, a lot of developers turn a blind eye to the costs that
Open Source incurs. I think that's because it does not cost us in the immediacy or monetarily. To be clear, I personally
think the costs associated are worth it, but it is something to be mindful of.

<br />

First, is the cost of training. No matter how _simple_ a person percives a library/framework to be, there is a cost to
learning it. Even if you do learn the framework it is **critical** that you keep your knowledge updated. It is a
continous learning process. I think JavaScript developers are more aware of this, and do complain about framework fatigue.

<br />

To cite an example, recently at work we had an intern facing some real issues working with a React project. So I had got on
a call with him to try and figure out what the issue was. The project he was working on was written on React 0.14. He had
learnt React via courses online, and was super confused because his functional hooks based code was not working in the
codebase. He had understood that he needed to convert to a class based implementation, but was not sure how he could do it.

<br />

To be perfectly clear, this is not the interns fault. Training is a cost that companines need to incur. The only way around this
is to keep your project up to date, and rely on the wonderful training that the community provides.

<br />

Interestingly, this need to reevaluate and relearn is not limited to major version upgrades. React's hooks paradigm was introduced
and widely adopted in a minor upgrade at React 16.8.

<br />

So at this point you have two choices. Keep your software up to date or invest in the the older versions.

<br />

If you choose to keep your software up to date, there is the cost of migrations from time to time. There will be breaking changes.
Though, I think the more costly problem is the retraining. You will have to convince your colleauges that it is worth it.

<br />

Your other choice is to not upgrade at all. There is a definite short term win here, but soon you would probably find that that
you did so at the cost of security. Maintainers of open source software do not(argubaly, should not) need to be concerend about
security issues in deprecated versions. All roads in this scenario lead you to fork and maintain a codebase you have no idea about
or rewrite your application without that dependecy.

<br />

To me, given the two choices it seems clear that keeping your dependencies up to date is preferable.

I think something that people sometimes lose sight of is that these changes are well advertised and well intentioned. For
example React has a (well documented RFC process)[https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0068-react-hooks.md]. They hold
conferences and market their changes.

I hope to build useful open source tools myself. So here are some notes to myself, as a user. Hopefully they might be uself to you too.

<br />

There are people who want to upgrade and keep up to date. If most of my users are always on the latest version, it reduces a significant
maintainence burden on me. These people are my allies in that goal.

<br />

I would like that all breaking changes are introduced as non breaking changes in a minor version upgrade. React Hooks is the perfect example.
The React team could have introduced this as React 17. It fundementally changed how you use the library. They could have shipped React without classes,
but chose to bare that cost. They had multiple reasons for doing so.

<br />

My reason? It's simply disheartening that changing a number and running `npm install` breaks my **entire** application. By giving the new
features alongside the old one you give people a reason to gradually adopt, learn and transform the codebase.

<br />

Have a good RFC process. Communicate your changes ahead of time. Community matters a lot in Open Source.
